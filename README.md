# React Counter App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates a counter functionality. It allows you to increment or decrement a count and see the date that corresponds to the calculated number of days in the future or past.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## App Structure

The app consists of a `Counter` component which uses the `useState` hook to manage the count and step values. It displays buttons to increment or decrement both the count and the step. The app also calculates a future or past date based on the count and displays it.

## Components

### `App`

The `App` component is the entry point of the application. It renders the `Counter` component.

### `Counter`

The `Counter` component manages the state of `count` and `step` using the `useState` hook. It renders buttons to adjust the count and step values and calculates the date based on the count. The calculated date is displayed beneath the buttons.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Use the "+" and "-" buttons next to "Step" to adjust the step value.
3. Use the "+" and "-" buttons next to "Count" to adjust the count value.
4. The app will dynamically calculate and display the date based on the count and step values.

## Future Enhancements

This app serves as a simple demonstration of using state and hooks in React. It can be further extended by adding more features, such as:

- A user interface to choose a custom start date.
- Additional options to change the date format.
- Styling improvements for better visual appeal.
